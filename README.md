# CSS elements

This is my custom css file for common html elements.

###This is not complete and I wish to continue it when school does not take up so much time. I also have to figure out what styles looks nice and fits with my theme. Then I will provide the classes for every element and publish it on a webpage so it is easy to see what class name to use for what type of element.
